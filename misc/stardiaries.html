								<h3>Stage play</h3>	
								<p style="text-align:center">Bedlam Theatre, University of Edinburgh<br/>Fall 2007</p>
								
	<h4>Introduction</h4>						
	<p>In the fall of 2007, I spent a semester at the University of Edinburgh taking classes in artificial intelligence and robotics. While there, I was drawn to the Edinburgh University Theatre Company. Composed entirely of students, the EUTC operates out of Bedlam Theatre: a 90-seat black box theatre inside a converted Gothic church on the former site of a mental asylum. Bedlam is both the company's year-round home and a famous Edinburgh Fringe venue.</p>
	<p>Since high school I had had a passion for theatre, and I had acting, stage management and construction credits on a plethora of amateur productions. I had yet to direct a show of my own, so I pitched the idea of adapting one of my favourite science fiction novels: <em>Star Diaries</em> by brilliant Polish author Stanisław Lem.</p>
	<h4>Adapting <em>Star Diaries</em></h4>
	<p>There were several hurdles. The book is composed of about twenty short journeys, each involving the protagonist Ijon Tichy in an absurd yet thought-provoking parody of a common science fiction trope. Furthermore, I only had access to the text in Bulgarian, and the book had never been adapted for the stage. I had to translate the sections of the book I wanted to use, adapt them into a stage play, and obtain permission to perform them.</p>
	<p>The copyright on the Bulgarian translation had reverted to the author. Since Mr. Lem had passed away the previous year, I contacted his estate and was able to obtain permission for a non-commercial performance from his secretary.</p>


<h4>Staging and performance</h4>
	<p>I selected three journeys: a time-loop in which multiple copies of Ijon Tichy vie for control of his ship, his role as representative of Earth in its first introduction to the Interplanetary Council, and a journey to a planet where teleportation and perfect bodily replication has been mastered. Each of these required complicated staging and props beyond the 60‎£ budget a first-year show was allocated.</p>
	<p>Fortunately, thanks to a dedicated team and a phenomenal cast, the show came together. Presented as the third and last show of the night, it began at 10:30 pm, but the audience's reaction at the end was extremely positive. The show worked extremely well as a late-night sci-fi parody, and watching it realized is still one of my most cherished memories.</p>
<h4>Bedlam</h4>
	<p>My time with Bedlam Theatre was instructive in another way. It was the first student theatre I'd worked at that had no "grown-up" oversight. The building was maintained entirely by students, which meant incredible freedom of experimentation with the space, but also a true sense of ownership.</p>
	
	<p>Students felt free to propose radical stunts like hanging dragon wings on the face of the building, or painting the entire interior white for a show, but were also responsible enough to only approve projects with value. Furthermore, members of the company descended on the building every Sunday for a weekly cleaning and maintenance session that no one complained about. While we were there, the theatre was ours, and I watched my peers grow and demonstrate responsibility for the space and the institution. This experience has stuck with me and has been an integral part of my teaching philosophy.</p>
